# # Operations on Word Vectors
# 
# Welcome to your first assignment of Week 2, Course 5 of the Deep Learning Specialization! 
# 
# Because word embeddings are very computationally expensive to train, most ML practitioners will load a pre-trained set of embeddings. In this notebook you'll try your hand at loading, measuring similarity between, and modifying pre-trained embeddings. 
# 
# **After this assignment you'll be able to**:
# 
# * Explain how word embeddings capture relationships between words
# * Load pre-trained word vectors
# * Measure similarity between word vectors using cosine similarity
# * Use word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to ______.  
# 
# At the end of this notebook you'll have a chance to try an optional exercise, where you'll modify word embeddings to reduce their gender bias. Reducing bias is an important consideration in ML, so you're encouraged to take this challenge!

# ## Packages

# Let's get started! Run the following cell to load the packages you'll need.

# In[1]:


import numpy as np

# ## 1 - Load the Word Vectors
# 
# For this assignment, you'll use 50-dimensional GloVe vectors to represent words. 
# Run the following cell to load the `word_to_vec_map`. 

# In[2]:


words, word_to_vec_map = read_glove_vecs('data/glove.6B.50d.txt')


# You've loaded:
# - `words`: set of words in the vocabulary.
# - `word_to_vec_map`: dictionary mapping words to their GloVe vector representation.
#

# ## 2 - Embedding Vectors Versus One-Hot Vectors
# Recall from the lesson videos that one-hot vectors don't do a good job of capturing the level of similarity between words. This is because every one-hot vector has the same Euclidean distance from any other one-hot vector.
# 
# Embedding vectors, such as GloVe vectors, provide much more useful information about the meaning of individual words.  
# Now, see how you can use GloVe vectors to measure the similarity between two words! 

# <a name='3'></a>
# ## 3 - Cosine Similarity
# 
# To measure the similarity between two words, you need a way to measure the degree of similarity between two embedding vectors for the two words. Given two vectors $u$ and $v$, cosine similarity is defined as follows: 
# 
# $$\text{CosineSimilarity(u, v)} = \frac {u \cdot v} {||u||_2 ||v||_2} = cos(\theta) \tag{1}$$
# 
# * $u \cdot v$ is the dot product (or inner product) of two vectors
# * $||u||_2$ is the norm (or length) of the vector $u$
# * $\theta$ is the angle between $u$ and $v$. 
# * The cosine similarity depends on the angle between $u$ and $v$. 
#     * If $u$ and $v$ are very similar, their cosine similarity will be close to 1.
#     * If they are dissimilar, the cosine similarity will take a smaller value.

# ### Exercise 1 - cosine_similarity
# 
# Implement the function `cosine_similarity()` to evaluate the similarity between word vectors.
# 
# **Reminder**: The norm of $u$ is defined as $ ||u||_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} u_i^2}$
# 
# #### Additional Hints
# * You may find [np.dot](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html), [np.sum](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html), or [np.sqrt](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sqrt.html) useful depending upon the implementation that you choose.

# * Measured the similarity between word vectors using cosine similarity
# * Used word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to __.

# Cosine similarity is a relatively simple and intuitive, yet powerful, method you can use to capture nuanced relationships between words. These exercises should be helpful to you in explaining how it works, and applying it to your own projects!  

# <font color='blue'>
#     <b>What you should remember</b>:
# 
# - Cosine similarity is a good way to compare the similarity between pairs of word vectors.
#     - Note that L2 (Euclidean) distance also works.
# - For NLP applications, using a pre-trained set of word vectors is often a great way to get started. </font>
